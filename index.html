    <p>Path tracing is a computer graphics rendering technique used to simulate the way light interacts with objects in a virtual scene to create realistic images. It is a method that attempts to model the physical behavior of light as it travels through a scene and interacts with it.</p>
    <p>This implementation uses WebGPU compute shaders. WebGPU is an API that exposes the capabilities of modern GPU hardware, allowing accelerated graphics and compute in web applications.</p>
